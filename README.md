# Ising-Model-Simulation
This is a simulation and analysis of the Ising model of ferromagnetism on a square and triangular lattice. It was an assignment for a computer simulation module in my 3rd year of college.

There are two files in this repo. The first is my python code in a Jupyter Notebook, and the second is a report of my findings.
